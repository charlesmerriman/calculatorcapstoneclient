 * `right-6` alone pins it to the viewport edge, and on a wide monitor that is a
 * long way from the column: the arrow reads as part of the screen rather than
 * part of the page. These park it just outside the column's right edge instead.
 * Half the viewport width left over after the column is the column's margin;
 * take off the button's own 3rem plus a gap and that is the offset. `max()`
 * keeps it 1.5rem inside the viewport once the margin is too narrow to hold it,
 * which is the old placement and the right one on a laptop.
 *
 * Measured off `100vw` rather than the scroller, so on desktop a classic
 * scrollbar (Windows, Linux) eats about half its width out of the gap. The gap
 * is sized with that in mind; it is not worth a measurement to get exact.
 *
 * Literal class strings rather than one built from the width, because Tailwind
 * only emits a class it can read whole from the source.
