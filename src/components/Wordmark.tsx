/**
 * The site's brand mark, as text rather than an image.
 *
 * Defined once and shared by every place the old logo PNG appeared (navbar,
 * sign-in card, OAuth callback card, closed-beta passcode card) so the brand
 * text, colour split and typeface only ever have to change in one file.
 *
 * Two variants, because the slots are shaped very differently:
 *  - "nav"  — sits in a 56px-tall bar next to other controls, so it stacks onto
 *             two lines and only unfolds to a single line from `lg` up. Wrapped
 *             in a link to the homepage, matching the old logo's behaviour.
 *
 *             The breakpoint is `lg`, not `md` where the desktop nav begins:
 *             in app mode that nav carries three centre links plus save/theme/
 *             settings/auth controls, and the single-line wordmark (~208px vs
 *             the old logo's ~74px) overflows the `grid-cols-[1fr_auto_1fr]`
 *             row between 768px and ~900px — the centre links collide and the
 *             auth button wraps to three lines. Stacked it is ~85px, narrower
 *             than the image it replaced, so it fits everywhere the logo did.
 *  - "card" — the tall centred header strip on the auth/beta cards. Always a
 *             stacked lockup, with "CALCULATOR" letter-spaced underneath.
 *
 * `font-display` resolves to the --font-display theme token (Outfit Variable,
 * bundled via @fontsource in main.tsx). Body text is untouched by this.
