 * The glyph on a row's type badge. Exported separately from the badge because

 *
 * Extracted because the desktop table row and the mobile card drew the same two
 * SVGs from two hand-copied ternaries. Adding a third banner kind meant finding
 * both, and a missed one silently rendered another kind's icon — the same
 * failure mode the FK sniffs had. One component, one place to extend.
 *
 * `className` carries the size and colour so each caller keeps its own scale
 * (w-5 in both today, but the desktop badge and the card sit in different type
 * scales and have diverged before).
