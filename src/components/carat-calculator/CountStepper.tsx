 * "−5 −1 +1 +5 | Max 20 | Next round") and ~320px ("Max 1200" on a large plan),
 * and a fixed width that fits the widest of those would leave the narrowest
 * padded out with dead space, while the old fixed 264 truncated "Next pity" the
 * moment both groups shared a row.
 *
 * The cap is what keeps it honest on a phone: below ~330px of viewport the row
 * wraps to two rather than running off the edge, which is why the chip row is
 * `flex-wrap`. Costs nothing on the layout either way — the pad is portal'd, so
 * it never competes with the banner table's width budget.
 *
 * Placement therefore measures WIDTH as well as height. This is only used if
 * that measurement is somehow unavailable.

 * WHY A PORTAL, and not the `relative` + `absolute` idiom SettingsMenu uses:
 * this pad opens from inside the banner sheet, and the sheet is wrapped in an
 * `overflow-hidden` panel (CaratCalculator) whose rows are `motion.div`s
 * carrying `layout` transforms. In-flow, the pad would be clipped at the panel's
 * bottom edge on the last row, and a `position: fixed` fallback would resolve
 * against the transformed row rather than the viewport. A portal to <body>
 * plus a rect measured from the anchor sidesteps both, at the cost of having to
 * re-place on scroll.
 *
 * WHY FOCUS IS THE ONLY TRIGGER: the pad is meant to save a click, not add one,
 * and focusing the field is something you were already doing to type in it — on
 * touch as much as with a mouse. It carried a chevron button underneath at
 * first, which bought discoverability at the price of pushing the input out of
 * line with the row's other bordered boxes on EVERY row, permanently, to
 * advertise something learned once. The field keeps its place instead.
 *
 * Chips suppress mousedown so focus never leaves the input, which is what lets
 * you click four of them in a row and keep arrow-keying afterwards.
