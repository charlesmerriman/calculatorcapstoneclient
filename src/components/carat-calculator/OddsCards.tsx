/**
 * The two pieces of the "which card are these odds for" control, shown only on
 * a banner with more than one rate-up card:
 *
 *   - OddsCaption: the line at the top of the odds strip. It names the card the
 *     strip is about, and doubles as the button that opens the panel, so the
 *     control costs no space of its own in the fixed-height table row.
 *   - OddsCardsPanel: the strip under the row (a band of the card on phones)
 *     where the player picks that card, ticks a second one for two-card
 *     odds, and chooses how far the first card is taken (one copy up to
 *     MLB). Every control is always rendered, the second-card ones greyed
 *     out until the box is ticked, so nothing moves when it is. Laid out like
 *     the note editor, for the same reason: the table row keeps its height
 *     and its columns.
 *
 * Both are plain view code. The choices they report are saved on the planned
 * row (`primary_card` / `second_card` / `primary_target`), resolved by
 * `oddsCards()` in utils/rateUpRates and `oddsTarget()` in utils/oddsDisplay,
 * and turned into numbers by the row.
