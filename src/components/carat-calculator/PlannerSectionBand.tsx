/**
 * A full-width section band between planner rows, marking a scenario launch or
 * an anniversary opening.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT `.banner-grid`: the band spans the row stack rather than
 * occupying columns, so it adds no track and leaves --container-banner-table
 * (and its hard ceiling) alone. Being a plain full-width block is also what
 * lets one component serve both display modes — the stack renders mobile cards
 * below the container width and table rows above it, and this reads correctly
 * either way.
 *
 * This is not AnniversaryEventStrip. That strip is left-aligned with squared
 * bottom corners because it welds onto the top of a timeline card; this is a
 * centred divider that belongs to neither neighbour.
 *
 * Each line links through to the same landmark's card on the Timeline. The band
 * names a scenario or a campaign and says nothing else about it — what launched
 * with it, what it looks like, how long it runs — and the Timeline is where all
 * of that already lives. See `utils/timelineFocus.ts` for why the link names a
 * target instead of pointing at a `#hash`.
