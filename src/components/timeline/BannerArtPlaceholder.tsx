 * Stand-in for a card's missing art.

 * Banner and event art is uploaded per row and is often absent for far-future,
 * still-predicted entries. Render this rather than letting the browser show a
 * broken-image glyph for an empty `image`.
 *
 * It holds the SAME 16:9 box a real image reserves (see BANNER_ART in
 * BannerWindowCard), not a min-height of its own. A stand-in that is a
 * different height from the thing it stands in for still moves the page when
 * the art finally arrives — which is the whole failure this box exists to
 * prevent.
