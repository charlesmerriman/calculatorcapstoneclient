/**
 * "11 umas join daily legend races", on the card of the banner a batch
 * arrives with. Links to that batch on the Legend Races tab.
 *
 * A pill in the card HEADER, beside the countdown, for the same reason the
 * staggered-release notes live there: the header sits outside the art row, so
 * nothing here can change the size of the art or the panels. A batch used to
 * be a card of its own in the stream, which floated between unrelated cards
 * with three short lines in a full-width box.
 *
 * The date is spelled out only when it differs from the window's, which is
 * the batches that land a day or three after their banner opens.
 *
 * Past tense once the batch is out ("16 umas joined"): with past events
 * shown, the Timeline lists banners from months ago, and "join" on one of
 * those reads as still to come. Judged against `now`, the same instant rule
 * the Legend Races page splits its two lists on (splitByToday).
