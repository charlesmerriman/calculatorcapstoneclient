 *

 * banner days before the support banner of that same window. The data stores
 * that as two BannerTimeline rows with identical JP dates and their own global
 * dates — correct, since each half's income is a function of its own end date —
 * and the shared `jp_start_date` is what says they are one release. No flag to
 * tick in the admin: copying the JP dates onto the second row is the whole
 * workflow. An unconfirmed pair predicts to the same instant from the same JP
 * date, so the JP rule only ever adds a group for rows global has confirmed
 * apart.
 *

 * with one global start and two different JP starts, and must stay one card.
 * The global start is looked up first and a key is never re-pointed, so every
 * start instant belongs to exactly one group — which is what keeps
 * timelineRowKey unique.
 *
 * Order is preserved — a group sits where its first constituent sat, so the
 * caller's sort still holds. The input is ascending by start, so that first
 * constituent is also the group's earliest.
 *
 * Pure, and called on an already-filtered list: grouping must run AFTER the
 * past/future split, or a group could straddle the boundary and drag an ended
 * banner into the current view. A staggered pair whose halves END on different
 * days therefore splits across that boundary once the first half is over.
