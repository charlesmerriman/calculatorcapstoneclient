/**
 * "Back to top" for an app whose scroll container is not always the same thing.
 *
 * THE WINDOW IS NOT THE SCROLLER HERE, and `window.scrollTo(0, 0)` is a no-op
 * on desktop. At the `app-shell` breakpoint (>=64rem wide AND >=32rem tall) the
 * shell is a fixed-height, no-scroll frame and the `overflow-y-auto` div inside
 * it does the scrolling — see views/ApplicationViews.tsx. Below that breakpoint
 * the shell is only `min-h-dvh`, so the same div grows to its content height,
 * never scrolls internally, and the document scrolls instead.
 *
 * Rather than detect which one is live — a computed-style walk that has to be
 * re-run whenever the viewport crosses the breakpoint — both halves of this hook
 * are asked in terms of an ANCHOR node parked at the top of the page:
 *
 * - to move, `scrollIntoView` on the anchor, which scrolls whatever ancestors
 *   need scrolling without being told which;
 * - to measure, the anchor's `getBoundingClientRect().top`, which is negative by
 *   exactly the distance the reader has travelled no matter what moved.
 *
 * The same reasoning is why hooks/useFocusScroll.ts uses `scrollIntoView` for
 * deep links; this is its counterpart for the return trip.

 * How far the reader travels before the control switches on.
