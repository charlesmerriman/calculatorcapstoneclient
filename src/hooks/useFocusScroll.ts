 * answer that by revealing more rows below the target (see
 * `FOCUS_TRAILING_ROWS` in Timeline.tsx); at the true end of the list, or on a

 * silent no-op on desktop. `scroll-margin-top` has no such problem: it shifts
 * where `scrollIntoView` parks the element, and the browser resolves it against
 * whatever scroller is actually live.
 *
 * The margin needed is not the offset itself — the scrollport does not start at
 * viewport y=0 (a navbar sits above it, and a sticky control band below that).
 * So the alignment CALIBRATES: park the node flush, measure where flush landed,
 * and the difference between that and the wanted offset is the margin. One extra
 * layout read, and nothing has to know the page's chrome heights.
 *
 * Negative margins are allowed through deliberately. A reader halfway down a
 * tall card has a negative offset — the card starts above the fold — and
 * clamping to zero would jump that card down to meet them, which is the movement
 * this exists to avoid.

/**
 * Scroll `target` to the top of its scroller, then keep correcting until the

 *
 * THE SCROLL IS INSTANT, AND THAT IS NOT A DOWNGRADE FROM A SMOOTH ONE.
 * `scrollIntoView` samples its destination once and animates towards that
 * fixed offset, so anything that grows above the target mid-flight leaves the
 * animation short. Lazy images make that a certainty rather than a risk: the
 * animation drags the viewport through every item above the target, which is
 * precisely what triggers those images to load and push it further down. The
 * further it travelled, the further it missed.
 *
 * Reserving image space removes the cause (see BANNER_ART in
 * BannerWindowCard); this loop covers what a declared ratio cannot predict — a
 * heading that wraps, a font that swaps, a panel that renders late.
 *
 * `scrollIntoView` is guarded because jsdom doesn't implement it: an unguarded
 * call would fail callers' tests rather than the feature. The loop itself needs
 * no guard — jsdom reports every rect as zero, which reads as "already stable"
 * and ends it two frames in.
 *
 * Runs as a LAYOUT effect, not a passive one. Both callers reach this from a
 * state change that rebuilt the list under the reader, so a passive effect can
 * leave a frame of the un-scrolled list on screen before correcting. That was
 * tolerable while the only caller was a deep link arriving on a fresh route; it
 * is not once the hook is also asked to hold a card still (see `offset`), where
 * a one-frame flick to the top of the list is the entire bug.
 *
 * @param target The node to bring into view.
 * @param key    Re-runs whenever this changes. Null disables the hook, which is
 *               how a caller says "no deep link" or "target not resolved yet".
 * @param offset Optional. Where on screen to park the node, in pixels from the
 *               top of the scrollport, INSTEAD of flush at the top. A ref rather
 *               than a value so it stays out of the dependency list — it is read
 *               at alignment time and must never be a reason to re-scroll on its
 *               own. Null or absent means the ordinary top-aligned landing.
