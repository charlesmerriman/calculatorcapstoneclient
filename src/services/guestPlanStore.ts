/**
 * The guest's plan, kept on this device.
 *
 * A guest's plan used to live in React state alone and a reload discarded it.
 * It now persists in localStorage under one key, and that is the WHOLE of guest
 * saving: nothing about a guest reaches the server. An account is what puts a
 * plan on every device; this is what keeps it on one.
 *
 * THREE RULES THIS FILE EXISTS TO HOLD
 *
 * 1. IDS, NEVER OBJECTS. A planned row in state carries the whole banner
 *    (name, image, predicted dates). Storing that would freeze the dates on the
 *    day of the save, and income is a function of a banner's end date, so a
 *    stale date is a wrong carat number. The store holds the PATCH shape
 *    (toBannerPayload and friends: FK ids only) and guestPlanToState() rebuilds
 *    the rows from the catalogue that was fetched a moment ago.
 *
 * 2. ONLY WHAT WAS TYPED WHILE SIGNED OUT. Account data is never written here,
 *    not on sign-out and not as a cache. Someone who signs out on a shared
 *    computer leaves nothing behind. CalculatorProvider enforces it by
 *    deciding guest-or-account once, at load (see `loadedAsRef` there).
 *
 * 3. LOCALSTORAGE IS NOT DURABLE, AND NOTHING HERE PRETENDS IT IS. Clearing
 *    site data deletes it, Safari deletes script-written storage after seven
 *    days without a visit, and a blocked store throws on every call. So every
 *    call is wrapped, a failed write is REPORTED (writeGuestPlan returns
 *    false) and a damaged entry degrades row by row instead of taking the plan
 *    with it.
 *
 * No expiry, unlike the sessionStorage stash this replaces (guestMigration.ts):
 * that was a one-hour handoff across a sign-in, this is the plan itself.
