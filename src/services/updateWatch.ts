/**
 * Update watch: notices when the deployed site has moved past the bundle this
 * tab is running, so the person can be told to refresh.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 *
 * The app is a single-page app, so a tab that is already open never reloads on
 * its own. Someone who opened the planner on Sunday is still running Sunday's
 * JavaScript on Wednesday, talking to Wednesday's API, and nothing tells them
 * a fix went out. That is how "the site is wrong for me" reports kept arriving
 * from builds that were days old.
 *
 * HOW IT WORKS
 *
 * Every build is stamped with an id (vite.config.ts) that is both compiled into
 * the bundle as `__BUILD_ID__` and written next to it as /version.json. This
 * module polls the file and compares. Different means a newer build is live.
 *
 * The poll runs on an interval while the tab is visible and again the moment a
 * hidden tab comes back to the foreground, which is exactly when a stale tab
 * wakes up. The request carries a cache-busting query string: the static site
 * sits behind a CDN that caches by full URL, and a fresh URL goes to origin.
 *
 * WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO
 *
 * It never reloads the page itself. The planner auto-saves, and a reload forced
 * in the middle of a save could drop a row. It notifies once per tab and leaves
 * the refresh to the person.
 *
 * It never nags on a bad answer. A missing /version.json is served as the SPA
 * catch-all document with a 200, so a response that is not JSON, or JSON without
 * a non-empty `build` string, is ignored rather than treated as a new version.
