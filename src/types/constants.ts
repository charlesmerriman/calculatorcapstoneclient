/**
 * Every tunable number the projection uses, as served by `/calculator-data`.
 *
 * Mirrors `CalculationConstantsSerializer`
 * (`backend/calculatorapi/views/calculation_constants.py`), which is generated
 * from the `CalculationConstants` model — read that model for what each field
 * means and which sheet cell it corresponds to.
 *
 * Field names stay snake_case to match the wire format exactly. A camelCase
 * mapping layer would be 35 more lines whose only job is to be a place for a
 * typo to hide.
 *
 * The decimal-valued fields arrive as NUMBERS, not DRF's default decimal
 * strings — the serializer coerces them, because `"0.664" * 2` is a silent NaN
 * in JavaScript rather than an error.
