/**
 * Daily legend race types.
 *
 * A release is a batch of umas joining the Daily Legend Races, usually with an
 * anniversary. Once in, each uma has her own race, once a day, forever, so a
 * player can grind several at once. Before that, an uma's only source of
 * pieces was her original limited Legend Race event.
 *
 * Nothing here touches the projection: pieces buy nothing the calculator
 * counts. The page and the pill on a Timeline banner card read it, nothing else.
