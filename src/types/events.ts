 * Reward amounts used to live on a separate EventReward model (one-to-many
 * with GameEvent). In practice every event had at most one immediate reward
 * and one throughout-the-event reward, so the two were folded directly onto
 * GameEvent as fields — carat_amount is earned once the event's own resolved
 * start_date passes, while carats_throughout is a pool the banner pays out
 * gradually over its run. What survives of that pool is evaluated ONCE against
 * today via a front-loaded decay curve, then credited whole to a single banner
 * (see getRemainingThroughoutCarats / sumRemainingThroughoutCarats in
 * utils/incomeCalculationUtils.ts). Only carats are ever distributed this way —
 * tickets/shards/crystals are always earned as a lump on start_date.
