 * A pull row's unit of account is a pity copy, so one preset lands exactly on
 * the next threshold, which is also what turns the field green (see
 * getPullCountStatus). Support rows drop ±10 because their plans move in whole
 * pities; a one-off multi is quicker typed (or Shift+arrow) than hunted for.
 *
 * NO "Max" ON A PULL ROW. It used to jump to the affordable ceiling, but
 * spending every pull you own on one banner is almost never the plan, and the
 * Max Pulls tile right beside the field already shows the number.
 *
 * A step-up row is a different unit entirely: `number_of_pulls` carries STEPS
 * there, and a plan is 5-15 of them. People buy whole rounds, so the ruler is
 * ±5 only (single steps stay on the arrow keys).
 *
 * @param stepLimit The most steps the banner SELLS (`max_steps`, which is
 *   `banner_count * 5`), NOT what the carats can pay for. With two banners and
 *   carats for 8 steps the chip still reads "Limit 10": over-planning past the
 *   budget is surfaced as a red field rather than prevented (same rule as
 *   handlePullCountChange), and the chip's job is "plan the whole thing".
 *   Named "Limit" so it cannot be read as the affordable "Max Steps" tile.
 *   Pass Infinity when no banner is chosen yet and the chip is dropped rather
 *   than invented. Ignored on pull rows.
