/**
 * Cumulative income from the projection anchor (today) to an arbitrary date.
 *
 * THE MODEL
 * ---------
 * Every function here answers one question: "how much of source X has accrued
 * between today and date E?" — as a closed form over the whole span, never as a
 * sum of per-banner windows.
 *
 * That is the whole point of the rewrite. The previous engine chained half-open
 * `(prevEnd, thisEnd]` windows, so every source needed an occurrence counter and
 * every counter had to *tile* — `(a,b] + (b,c] === (a,c]` — or totals drifted
 * with how many banners the user happened to plan. Tiling is a property you have
 * to prove for each counter and can silently lose; a closed form from a fixed
 * anchor has nothing to lose. It is also what the source spreadsheet does, one
 * column per source (`Carat Calculator` cols AN..AV), which is what makes the two
 * comparable at all.
 *
 * Each function names the sheet cell it reproduces. Where we knowingly differ,
 * the comment says so — those are the items the parity harness settles.
 *
 * All arithmetic is UTC (see ./utcDates). `today` is midnight UTC; `now` is the
 * live instant, and the two are NOT interchangeable — the sheet uses `$AG$3`
 * (TODAY) for span measures and `$AG$2` (NOW) for the event filters.
 *
 * Every function takes the constants as its last argument rather than importing
 * them: they are admin-editable and arrive with the API response, so a module
 * import would freeze them at build time.
