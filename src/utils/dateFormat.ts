 * The app's single user-facing date formatter.

 * dependence, so every user sees the same string. Every date the UI renders
 * goes through here, which means the format only ever has to change in one
 * place. Before this existed the same logic was copy-pasted into BannerRow,
 * StagedBannerRow, UncapCrystalsPanel and the changelog helper, and the four
 * copies had already drifted apart (two locales and two timezone bases).

/**
 * Parse a date string from the API into a Date.
 *
 * Two different shapes arrive from DRF and they must be parsed differently:
 *
 * - **Date-only** — `"2026-07-16"`, e.g. `ChangelogEntry.date` (a DateField).
 *   Handing these to `new Date()` parses them as UTC midnight, which renders as
 *   the *previous* calendar day in any negative-offset timezone. We split the
 *   parts by hand and build a local-midnight Date instead.
 * - **Full instants** — `"2025-06-26T22:00:00Z"`, every banner/event date
 *   (DateTimeFields). These carry a real time and offset, so `new Date()` is
 *   both correct and necessary.
 *
 * Returns null when the string is neither.
