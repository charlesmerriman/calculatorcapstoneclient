 *     before the last row's start are eligible, so a band never opens the list.
 *  3. A SCENARIO pins immediately above its own launch banner when that banner
 *     is on the sheet, whatever else shares that start instant. This is what
 *     puts the band before its corresponding banner rather than before some
 *     other banner opening the same day.
 *  4. Everything else places by date — before the first row starting on or
 *     after it. Campaigns the user planned no banner for still get a band;
 *     that context is the point of the feature.
 *  5. Markers landing at the same point collapse into ONE band row carrying
 *     several lines, scenarios first.
 *

 * not occupy an insertion point, or turning anniversaries off would leave the
 * scenario sharing that point rendering as the second line of a one-line band.
