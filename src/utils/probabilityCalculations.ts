 *

 *
 *   - The cards share pulls. One pull gives A, or B, or neither, never both,
 *     so the counts are a three-way split of the same pulls, not two coins:
 *
 *         P(i of A, j of B) = Binomial(pulls, i; rateA)
 *                           x Binomial(pulls - i, j; rateB / (1 - rateA))
 *
 *     (the second factor is B's chance among the pulls that were NOT A).
 *
 *   - The free copies are ONE pot for the whole banner, spent after pulling:
 *     one exchange per 200 pulls, plus the row's reserved copies, which buy a
 *     copy of whichever card needs it just as an exchange does. The pot goes
 *     to A until A reaches the target, and the rest goes to B. So a reserved
 *     copy A turned out not to need is a copy of B, not a wasted one.
 *
 *   - A past the target still counts. Extra copies of A are luck, not a
 *     miss, so with a target of one copy the row "pulls gave three of A" is
 *     in, and every free copy on it goes to B.
 *
 * Because A gets the pot first, the six cells always add up to the one-card
 * strip's cells from the target up (its MLB cell when the target is MLB). A
