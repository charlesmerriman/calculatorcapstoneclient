/**
 * Per-pull chance of each rate-up card on an ordinary uma or support banner.
 *
 * Not a flat 0.75%. The global client's own gacha table shows one rule behind
 * every ordinary banner: each card gets its rarity's usual rate-up chance,
 * unless more cards share the rate-up than that rarity's pool allows, in which
 * case the pool is split evenly between them:
 *
 *     rate = min(rate_up_rate_N, rate_up_pool_N / rate-up cards of rarity N)
 *
 *     1 SSR, or 2 SSRs          -> 0.75% each   (2 x 0.75% fits inside 3%)
 *     20 SSRs (launch banner)   -> 0.15% each   (3% / 20)
 *     a ★3 and a ★2 on one banner -> 0.75% and 2.25%, each against its own pool
 *
 * Two editor-set inputs bend it. A select banner ("10 Select 2") lists every
 * card the player COULD pick, but only the picks are rate-ups, so the pool is
 * split by `rate_up_picks` rather than the list. And a card whose rate breaks
 * the rule outright carries a `rate_overrides` entry, which wins.
 *
 * The numbers come from the API (`calculation_constants`) and are passed in,
 * like every other constant. Step-ups do not come through here: their odds are
 * stepUpLadder.ts.
