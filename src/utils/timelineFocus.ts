/**
 * The deep-link contract between the calculator sheet and the Timeline.
 *
 * The calculator is a ledger: it tells you what a banner costs, not what is on
 * it or what else is happening that week. The Timeline answers that, so the
 * sheet links across — a scenario band opens that scenario's card, a row's card
 * art opens the banner window it belongs to.
 *
 * A plain `#hash` anchor cannot do this. The Timeline windows its list (ten
 * cards a page, or a growing prefix under infinite scroll) and hides past
 * events by default, so the target element usually is not in the DOM for the
 * browser to scroll to. The link therefore names the target and the Timeline
 * resolves it — widening its own window and flipping to the past view as
 * needed. See `Timeline.tsx`.
 *
 * Lives in `utils/` rather than beside the Timeline because both ends of the
 * link have to agree on the format, and the calculator must not have to reach
 * into the timeline's component folder to build a URL.
 */

/**
 * What a link points at.
 *
 * `id` is the SOURCE ROW's primary key — a `BannerTimeline`, a `Scenario` or an
 * `AnniversaryEvent` — never a rendered row's index or React key, both of which
 * shift as the list is filtered.
 *
 * `kind` deliberately mirrors `TimelineMarker["kind"]` for the two marker
 * cases, so neither surface needs a translation table: a marker of kind
 * "scenario" focuses a focus of kind "scenario".
 *
 * NOTE a banner's id is its `BannerTimeline`, not the `BannerUma` /
 * `BannerSupport` / `BannerStepUp` a planner row actually points at. Concurrent
 * banners are merged into one timeline card, and all three planner row kinds
 * carry the same `banner_timeline` FK, so the timeline is the only id that
 * identifies a card from any of them.
