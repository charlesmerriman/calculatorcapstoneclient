/**
 * The owner of the /app routes' document titles and descriptions. Renders nothing.
 *
 * WHY IT LIVES HERE AND NOT IN EACH PAGE
 *
 * The three routed pages mount only once /calculator-data has landed — see the
 * loading gate in ApplicationViews. A `useDocumentMeta` call inside them is
 * therefore invisible to whatever reads the page before that fetch resolves:
 * the browser tab while the spinner shows, an error state, a search crawler,
 * and a build-time render. One component that sits OUTSIDE the gate fixes all
 * four with one mount. (The tab used to read "Uma Musume Carat Calculator" for
 * the whole of the loading spinner; now it reads "Calculator | …" from the
 * first frame.)
 *
 * Until 2026-09-13 this component also rendered a short "how to read this"
 * block under each page. That prose was removed at the owner's request; the
 * guide and the FAQ carry the explanations, and the head tags carry the route.
